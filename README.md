# BBIY

This is a tribute to the game Baba Is You, an innovative puzzle game developed by Hempuli Oy.
This game was written for a final project for my game development course, and seeks to emulate
the technical demo for the game, which features five levels and a limited number of in-game modifiers

## Building and Running

This project was developed in C# using Monogame. In order to run the project, you first need to install
the [.NET CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/), which contains the utilities needed
to build and run the project. To build and run the project, run the following commands from the repo directory:

```
$ dotnet build

$ dotnet run
```

This **should** be enough to run the game and play it. If you run into errors, look for help running .NET
utilities for your system.
